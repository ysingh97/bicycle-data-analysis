Analysis of bicycle data as part of Google Data Analysis Certificate

## Process

I analyzed data from an imaginary company called Cyclistic. I used 8,587,768 rides from 2014 to 2017 to determine how casual users and subscribers use Cyclistic bikes. First I merged multiple datasets and then cleaned them for analysis. I then created summary statistics and analyzed the data, after which I visualized them in R using ggplot. Please see the R Markdown PDF file for the R code used for all of these steps.
